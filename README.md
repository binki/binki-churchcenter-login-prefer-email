Fix ChurchCenter’s login page to default to email login.

If you are trying to log in, it is annoying to see the phone number option appear first instead of the email. Email works on all platforms. This allows copying and pasting the code when using a desktop. Also, accounts don’t necessary have phone numbers set up.
